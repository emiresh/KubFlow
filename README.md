# KubFlow Application

This repository contains the implementation and deployment instructions for the KubFlow application. KubFlow is a Kubernetes-based solution that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in software development. It automates the build, test, and deployment processes, providing a streamlined workflow for deploying microservices applications.

## Implementation

### Deployment Infrastructure (Kubernetes Cluster) - Using Terraform

To establish the Kubernetes cluster, Terraform is utilized as a tool for infrastructure provisioning and management. The Terraform configuration files for setting up the cluster can be found in the [Terraform directory](https://github.com/emiresh/KubFlow/tree/master/Terraform) of this repository.

To deploy the Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. Execute `terraform init` to initialize Terraform.
2. Execute `terraform plan` to review the planned infrastructure changes.
3. Execute `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and provision the Kubernetes cluster.

### Kubernetes Infrastructure

The Kubernetes cluster consists of a three-node setup, including one master node and multiple worker nodes. The master node is responsible for controlling and managing the other nodes, ensuring centralized control and coordination of the cluster's resources and operations.

The details of the master node (server) and worker nodes (agents) can be found in the KubFlow repository.

### Configuring GitHub Repositories

For CI/CD purposes, two separate GitHub repositories have been set up: `kubflowci` for the CI pipeline and `kubflowcd` for the CD pipeline. All related files are pushed to their respective repositories.

### Deploying Argo CD with HELM Chart

Argo CD, a continuous delivery tool, is deployed to automate the deployment of microservices applications. The deployment process involves creating a separate namespace called "argocd" to host the deployment. By utilizing the provided HELM chart from Argo CD's Artifact Hub link (https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/argo/argo-cd), Argo CD is installed and configured within the namespace.

To establish the connection between the `kubflowcd` GitHub repository and Argo CD, the `kubflowcd` repository is added as a new application using an Argo CD manifest file. This integration enables seamless synchronization between the CD repository and Argo CD. Updates made to the `kubflowcd` repository through the Jenkins pipeline trigger automatic deployment of the changes to the Kubernetes cluster.

### Setting up the Jenkins Server

Jenkins is used as an automation server for CI/CD in software development. It facilitates automated build, test, and deployment processes and supports integration with various development, testing, and deployment tools through plugins.

Two pipelines, `kubflowci` for continuous integration and `kubflowcd` for continuous delivery, are implemented using Jenkins. The Jenkins files for these pipelines are stored in separate GitHub repositories: [kubflowci](https://github.com/emiresh/kubflowci) and [kubflowcd](https://github.com/emiresh/kubflowcd). A webhook is utilized to establish a connection between the `kubflowci` pipeline and the `kubflow` GitHub repository, triggering the pipeline automatically upon updates in the repository.

### Installing and Configuring an Ingress Controller

The NGINX Ingress Controller is deployed to the KubFlow Kubernetes cluster to provide external access to the deployed applications. By creating an Ingress resource, traffic can be directed to different services based on URL paths or hostnames, effectively managing incoming traffic within the cluster. The NGINX Ingress Controller acts as a cost-effective load balancer, eliminating the need for multiple expensive load balancers for each application.

Follow the instructions provided by the NGINX Ingress Controller documentation [here](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#using-helm) for installing the NGINX Ingress Controller using HELM.

### Deploying Testing Applications on the Kubernetes Cluster

To test the functionality of the Kubernetes cluster, two simple applications are deployed on the cluster. These applications are stored in the `kubflowci` repository, available at [https://github.com/emiresh/kublflowci](https://github.com/emiresh/kublflowci). Jenkins is used to create a Docker image and store it in Docker Hub. The applications are automatically deployed within a few minutes using the KubFlow infrastructure without manual intervention. High availability of the application is also tested by deploying multiple replicas, ensuring successful implementation of high availability measures.

### Setting up Kubernetes Monitoring

Kubernetes monitoring is established using Prometheus, an open-source monitoring and alerting tool. The following steps are followed:

1. Install Prometheus: Prometheus is installed to collect metrics from various targets within the cluster.
2. Configure Prometheus: Prometheus is configured to scrape and store the collected metrics data. Service Discovery is enabled to automate the discovery and scraping of metrics from Kubernetes pods, services, and other targets.
3. Create Prometheus Alerting Rules: Alerting rules are defined in Prometheus to monitor specific metrics and trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions.
4. Configure Alertmanager: Alertmanager is installed and configured to receive alerts from Prometheus, manage their routing, and send notifications through channels such as email, Slack, PagerDuty, or custom endpoints.

A dedicated Slack channel is set up for alert management and notification. Alerts detected by Prometheus and Alertmanager are sent to the designated Slack channel, ensuring timely notification of critical issues or incidents.

Comprehensive testing is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Prometheus monitoring setup. Test alerts are generated and verified in the Slack channel to confirm the proper functioning of the monitoring system.

### Creating Grafana Dashboard for Visualization

Grafana, a data visualization and monitoring tool, is deployed to visualize the metrics collected by Kubernetes monitoring. To set up Grafana with Prometheus and Alertmanager, follow these steps:

1. Install Grafana: Deploy Grafana using the kube-prometheus stack and configure Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
2. Create a custom Grafana dashboard: Design a specific Grafana dashboard to display Kubernetes-related metrics and visualizations, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and network traffic.
3. Utilize Grafana's query editor: Add Prometheus queries in the Grafana query editor to specify the data source, metric, and aggregation functions required to retrieve the desired metrics data.
4. Organize the dashboard panels strategically: Arrange the panels on the dashboard to provide a comprehensive view of the Kubernetes cluster's performance and health.
5. Apply visualization options: Leverage visualization options such as graphs, charts, and gauges to effectively represent the metrics data.

Validate the accuracy of the visualization to ensure it accurately represents the status and performance of the Kubernetes cluster.

### Testing KubFlow with Test Cases

Test cases are designed and executed to thoroughly examine the functionality and performance of the KubFlow solution. Each test case covers different aspects, including application functionality, scalability, error handling, and data integrity. The automated CI/CD pipeline is executed, and the deployment of microservices in the Kubernetes cluster is monitored to identify potential issues or bugs.

By testing and verifying the solution, necessary improvements can be made to ensure a robust and reliable CI/CD process.
